    "Passing by reference is similar passing a pointer to a variable instead of copying the value of the variable. But in Python, passing by reference can occur without creating the pointer explicitly, as it is done in C or C++. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Metaphorically speaking...\n",
    "Passing by reference or by value frequently occurs in calling functions. Suppose you are the function and I am passing you information metaphorically in terms of information written on paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Call by value is where I copy something from one piece of paper onto another piece of paper and hand the copy to you. Maybe the information includes that `x=5`. This information is now on a piece of paper which I have given to you, so now it is effectively your piece of paper. You are now free to write on that piece of paper to use that information however you please. Maybe you decide to act upon this information by multiplying the variable `x` by 2, so that you write that now `x=10` on your piece of paper. Suppose you return that piece of paper to me. Does this change what was written on my piece of paper? No! However, I may choose to use your information to then update the information on my original paper.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * Call by reference is when I give you my original paper which has something written down in it like `x=5`. Now, if you decide that the value of `x` should be double so that you erase and replace `x=5` with `x=10` and then give me the paper back, my paper now contains this updated information about `x` regardless if I wanted it to or not. I guess if I did not want that information to be there, then I should have passed by value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technically speaking...\n",
    "####  *Passing by reference*\n",
    "This means Python passes the reference to the variable, not just the value.  This can cause some different behavior when certain *in place* operators are used.  Classes, numpy arrays, etc. are passed by reference.\n",
